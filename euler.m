% EULER Uses Euler's Method to calculate the solution to an ODE.
%
% [t, states] = euler(odefun, tspan, y0) uses Euler's Method to calculate
%   the solution to the ODE defined by the system of equations odefun, over the
%   time steps defined by tspan, with the initial conditions y0.  The time
%   output is stored in the array t, while the dependent variables are stored in
%  the array states.  Euler's Method uses the equation:
%                       dY
%       Y(i+1) = Y(i) + -- delta_t
%                       dt
%   where delta_t is the time step, Y(i) is the values of the dependent
%   variables at the current time, Y(i+1) is the values of the dependent
%   variables at the next time, and dY/dt is the derivative function
%   evaluated at the current time.
%
% Inputs:
%   odefun - A function handle to the derivative function defining the system.
%   tspan - An array of t (or other independent variable) at which to evaluate
%           Euler's Method.  The num_times values in this array determine the size
%           of the outputs.
%   y0    - A value containing the initial condition to be used in evaluating
%           the derivative_function.  Must be the same size as that expected fo
%           the second input of derivative_function.
%
% Outputs:
%   t  - A (num_times, 1) array of times (or other independent variable) at which
%        Euler's Method was evaluated.
%   y - A (num_times, 1) array of dependent variables at which Euler's Method was
%       evaluated.
