% Script to compute the increase in icidence of a plant pathogen (or any
% pathogen with stationary hosts).  This code is 0-D (time only) and
% predicts the growth of the pathogen for a host with a population that
% grows in size with time.
%
% The primary equations governing this are compound interest equations for
% growth:
%
% dS/dt = -beta*S*I+k
%
% dL/dt = beta*S*I-mu_l*L+e
%
% dI/dt = mu_l*L*I-mu_i*I
%
% dR/dt = mu_i*I
%
% with:
% S    = susceptible fraction of population (susceptible tissue)
% beta = rate of infection growth for healthy population (fraction per day)
% L    = fraction of tissue infected and latent (e.g., dormant before infection)
% I    = fraction of tissue infected and producing inoculum
% R    = fraction of tissue recovered (or removed) from population
% t    = time
% mu_l = rate of decrease in latent population (fraction per day)
% mu_i = rate of decrease in infectious population (fraction per day)
% k    = growth rate of the host population (fraction per day)
% e    = rate of import from external sources
%
% inputs: S_i (initial size of susceptible population); k; beta; mu;
% days (number of days to simulate); dt (time step,fraction of a day)
% output: S,I,R,time (vector of simulation times)
